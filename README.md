# a DAG CNN Implementation backed on MatConvNet

**MatConvNet** is a MATLAB toolbox implementing *Convolutional Neural
Networks* (CNNs) for computer vision applications. It is simple,
efficient, and can run and learn state-of-the-art CNNs. Several
example CNNs are included to classify and encode images. Please visit
the [homepage](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet) to know more.

## What'sNew
+ **DAG** We reimplement the network architecture towards a fully DAG topology.
+ **MultiTask** 
+ **concat** layer.  

## A Fast Example
1. copy multitasknn/ to */path/to/Matconvnet/*, add this fold into you Matlab path
2. run multitask/exmaple/fast_test_mt_cnn.m
